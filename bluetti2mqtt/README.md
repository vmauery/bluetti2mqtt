MQTT bridge between Bluetti and Home Assistant.

This is a simple Home Assistant add-on for [bluetti_mqtt](https://github.com/ftrueck/bluetti_mqtt).

This add-on was created as an easy method to get Bluetti data into Home Assistant, without having to setup [bluetti_mqtt](https://github.com/ftrueck/bluetti_mqtt) on a separate device.
